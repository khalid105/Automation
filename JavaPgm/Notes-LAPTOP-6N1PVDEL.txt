if user seen some where double quotes "<Anything>"--- String


if string is coming first and then plus symbol is there next part automatically 
convert into the String 


if user seen some where void symbol -- that is called a Method

What is class ?

class is a combination of Methods , objects and Constructor

if any thing is missing we can't execute our pgm


Constructor name and class name should be same - that is mandatory 


What is Object ?


Object is a replica of class or we can say blue print of the class

Inheritance :-Aquaring a properties from the parent class - that is called 
a inheritance and we can achieve with the help of extends keyword in java

What is Multi level inheritance


step by step inheritance or we can generation by generation transformation 
is also known as Multi level inheritance



what is Multiple inheritance

If one class want to inherit more than one class at a time - that is called a 
Multiple Inheritance


can we achieve multiple inheritance in java

No , we cant achieve at class level but we can achieve at interface level

what is the major difference multiple and multi level inheritance


what is single inheritance and Inheritance both is same

child parent relation

what is Many to One onheritance


what is one to Many Inheritance - and Multiple Inheritance both is same
and we can achieve at interface level 


IS- A relation -- Inheritance , Multilevel inheritance

Has - A relation-- Multiple Inheritane - Interface only


Assignment - try to work on Any one of the example of Many to One Inheritance


Try to create a pgm for currency - according to region it should print which country 
currency is running 


USA a = new USA()

Method Over riding -


Method Over riding :- We have to apply same methods but it should be in different classes
and we can achive with the help of extends keyword and Implementation should be different


Method Over loading :- we have to apply same methods but it should be in same class 
but signature/Parameter/Data type should be different 

Data Type 

by default any whole number is int

int - whole number ---- Medium range
long- whole number -- high range
short - whole number -- less than int and higher than byte
byte--- whole number -- very less range


by default any decimal value is double

double  -- decimal value  --- high range
float--- decimal value-- low range

char -- 'a' 'b'
boolean  -- true and false

String --- String is not a data type - it is a class and we will use like a data type - "<anything>"



Constructor :- 

Construtcor name and class name should be same

if user is not declaring any constructor  jvm will call default and blank constructor

if user is declaring any constructor - jvm will not call default and blank constructor

constructor doesnt contains any return type - like void


Polymorphism :- Same object behaving different different instance through out the execution of the pgm 
that is called a polymorphism


Run Time Polymorphism -- Method Over riding , Upcasting

Upcasting - trying to create a object of parent class and call child Constructor

Compile Time Polymorphism  - Method Over loading



Super Keyword 


1 - Super means - Parent 


super can be a Variable
super can be a Method
Super can be a Constructor

Remember - Always super we can use along with inheritance only

if Parent class constructor doesnt have any parameter super will invoke 
by default 

super and This constructor always be a first statement - Mandatory


This Keyword 

This - Current



This can be a Variable
This can be a Method
This can be a Constructor

Static 


Variable can be Static
Method can be a static

nested class can be a static

if we are declaring any thing static no need to create object we can access with the help of classname

classname.variable or method we can call 






stack memory   heap memory    class memory

color            blue          color = blue



Abstraction :- 

Abstract is a Keyword 

Abstact can be a class and Methods

if class is abstract , we can create abstract and non abstract method

Abstract method - Unimplemented method or we can say with out body

Non Abstract method - Implemented method with body what we did earlier

Abstarct class is not a complete class - because we cant create a object of abstract class 

we cant achieve 100 % abstraction as well in Abstract class


Interface :- 

Interface is also a keyword

interface can keep only abstract method

interface can achieve 100% abstraction

in interface by default any method is abstract no need to give abstract keyword in method

class - class - extends

class - interface - implements


interface - interface - extends


class - class

class - interface

interfcae - class
interface - interface
